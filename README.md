The folders in this directory include the data sets used in "Robust Alternative Fuel Refueling Station Location Problem with Routing under Decision-Dependent Flow Uncertainty" by Özlem Mahmutoğulları and Hande Yaman. The data sets are generated based on the Belgian road network and population. The information regarding the locations of Belgian municipalities and the distances between municipalities was obtained from Google Maps (2021), and the information regarding the populations of Belgian municipalities was obtained from the Belgian statistical office STATBEL (2020).
